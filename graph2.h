/*
 * Implementation of common 2/3-graph routines:
 * - build a 2/3-graph with hash-pairs as edges
 * - check a 2/3-graph for acyclicness and compute an output order
*
 * For each vertex in the 2/3-graph, the incidence lists need to kept.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Avoid storing the full list by just XORing the indices of the still
 * incident edges and the number of such edges as that's all the peeling
 * computation needs. This is inspired by:
 *   Cache-Oblivious Peeling of Random Hypergraphs by Djamal Belazzougui,
 *   Paolo Boldi, Giuseppe Ottaviano, Rossano Venturini, and Sebastiano
 *   Vigna. https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0526
 *
 * Unlike in the paper, we don't care about external storage and have
 * the edge list at hand all the time. As such, no ordering is necessary
 * and the vertices of the edge don't have to be copied.
 *
 * The core observation of the paper above is that for a degree of one,
 * the incident edge can be obtained directly.
